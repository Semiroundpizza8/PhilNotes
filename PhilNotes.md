### A Valid Argument
The current vice president will win the next election.
If the current vice president wins the next election, then the country will prosper.
So, the country will prosper.

All fish fly.
Anything which flies, talks.
Therefore - all fish talk.

A valid argument can have a false premisis, leading to a false conclusion.
Validity isnt about truth or falsity, its about whether or not a specific conclusion can be reached

### An Invalid Argument
If God exists, then the creation is perfect.
God doesnt exist.
Therefore, creation is imperfect.

In ordinary english, the terms 'Valid'/'True' and 'Invalid'/'False' are often used interchangably. For logicians its used in a more restricted way, where 'v' and 'iv' are only for arguments, and 't' or 'f' are only for 

OR = and/or
EITHER = or

Any creature with a kidney has a heart. <- Premise
Not every creature has a kidney.        <- Premise
So, not every creature has a kidney.    <- Conclusion

Everybody loves someone.                <- Premise
So, someone is loved by everyone.       <- Conclusion

There is evil in the world.                   <- Premise
If there were a God, there would be no evil.  <- Premise
Therefore, there is no God.                   <- Conclusion

God exists.                                   <- Premise
God doesn't exist.                            <- Premise
So, Chicago is west of New York.              <- Conclusion

In the above, 36 and 37 contradict each other.
While 38 is unrelated.
If we cannot determine if the premises are true, we cannot conclude that the end is false.
It is impossible that the premises are true and the conclusion is false.
From a contridiction, anything can be true.

This teacher is confusin                              <- Premise
The content is probably on YouTube                    <- Premise
Therefore, I should be playing Hearthstone right now  <- Conclusion

### Conclusions
An argument whose premises are necessarily false is valid.
An argument whose conclusion is necessaruily true is valid.

A good argument is not simply deductively valid; The following argument is deductively valid but unlikely to persuade anyone:
All fish fly.
Anything which flies, talks.
Therefore - all fish talk.
Though it is not possible for both to be true and false, the argument is unlikely to persuade anyone because 55 and 57 are false.

Normally, good arguments are not only deductively valid, but also have true premises.... making them sound.
**A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are all true**
* If an argument is unsound, then it's invalid. -- *FALSE*
* If an argument is valid, then it's premises are true. -- *FALSE*
* If an argument is valid, then its conclusion is true. -- *FALSE*
* If the premises of a given argument are true, and the conclusion is also true, then the argument is valid. -- *FALSE*

### If... Then
* If abortion is murder, then abortion is morally wrong.    <- If p then q
* Abortion is murder.                                       <- p
* So, Abortion is morally wrong.                            <- So, q
Valid form of argument

* If the world was created by God, then it will exhibit order and lawfullness.  <- If p, then q
* The world does exhibit order and lawfullness                                  <- q
* So, the world was created by God.                                             <- So, p
Invalid form of argument

#### Not with If...Then
* If mental states are brain states, then they are located in space   <- If p then q
* But mental states are not located in space.                         <- Not q
* So, mental states are not brain states                              <- So, not P
Valid

* If God were at all evil, then the world could be better than it is. <- If p then q
* But God is not at all evil.                                         <- Not p
* So, the world could not be better than it is.                       <- So, not q
Invalid

#### Both... and with not
* Space cannot be both finite and unbounded.  <- Not both p and q
* Space is unbounded.                         <- p
* So, space is not finite.                    <- So, not q
Valid argument, Valid form.

* Mercy killing cannot be both morally obligatory and morally wrong.  <- Not both p and q
* It is surely not morally obligatory.                                <- Not p
* So, mercy killing must be morally wrong.                            <- So, q
Invalid, example of counter example. Premises are true, conclusion is false.

Sound arguments are all valid.
But not all valid arguments are sound.
